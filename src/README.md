## Abstract
The Romcom project is designed to enhance our understanding of javascript and DOM structure and how they interact. We manage to utilize event listeners and event handlers. 


## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - node
  - VS Code
  

## Code Architecture
We construct our main.js file into sections based on their function. The sections are variable declaration, event handlers, and functions. 


## Wins
- We finished on time. 
- Every iteration works according to the specifications.


## Challenges + Improvements
- The biggest difficulty was how to select the elemnt we click/double click.
- Another challenge was to find the rignt syntax to incorporate a section of HTML saved covers iterating through an array.
- It was challenge to find the rignt time to work together due to time zone difference.
